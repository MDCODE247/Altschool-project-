        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            My name is Mohammed Abubakar and i am a software engineering student
            (backend track) at Altschool Africa school of engineering. My
            academic journey led me to the college of medicine, Ahmadu Bello
            university, Zaria where i obtained my first degree. I am a curious
            cat and with a spirit as bright as the sun, i fearlessly take on new
            challenges with unyieling determination and grace regardless of the
            complexity.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am fluent in English and Hausa. I find french very beautiful and
            interesting and i am making concious effort to learn the language
          </p>

          <p>
            As an introverted person, i find solace in reading African fiction.
            I also believe that in the vast landscape of human knowledge and
            immagination, there are those who navigate through multiple worlds,
            drawing inspiration from the intersection of diverse fields. I am a
            testament to the beauty of multidisciplinary passions and crafts.
            Often times, you will catch me talking about books, tech, medicine
            and yes, as a concerne citizen, i never fail to comment on the
            economy and falling value of our naira at any chance i get.
          </p>

          <p>
            With an unwavering love for molecular research, neuroscience, and
            medicine, i hope to embark on a remarkable journey that bridges
            science and technology, demonstrating the rich tapestry of human
            curiosity and contributing to a better world.
