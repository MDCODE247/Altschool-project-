        <h1> Biography </h1>
<article>
        <p> 
            My name is Mohammed  Abubakar and i am a software engineering student (backend track) at Altschool Africa school of engineering. My academic journey led me to the college of medicine, Ahmadu Bello university, Zaria where i obtained my first degree. I am a curious cat and with a spirit as bright as the sun, i fearlessly take on new challenges with unyieling determination and grace regardless of the complexity.</p>

            <p> I am fluent in English and Hausa. I find french very beautiful and interesting and i am making concious effort to learn the language</p>

            <p>As an introverted person, i find solace in reading African fiction. I also believe that in the vast landscape of human knowledge and immagination, there are those who navigate through multiple worlds, drawing inspiration from the intersection of diverse fields. I am a testament to the beauty of multidisciplinary passions and crafts. Often times, you will catch me talking about books, tech, medicine and yes, as a concerne citizen, i never fail to comment on the economy and falling value of our naira at any chance i get.</p>

            <p> With an unwavering love for molecular research, neuroscience, and medicine, i hope to embark on a remarkable journey that bridges science and technology, demonstrating the rich tapestry of human curiosity and contributing to a better world.</p>
